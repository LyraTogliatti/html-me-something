				<h2>Bloodborne</h2>
				<p>
				When I was a child, I would often wonder what secrets developers hid in the game
				I was playing.  Programming and game development were worlds of infinite possibilities
				and nothing gave me more of a drive to continue playing.  Bloodborne is the first game
				in my life to fully warrant this idea.  Years after release, new bosses are still
				being discovered in the Chalice Dungeons; cut characters are changing the context
				of the story, while hidden voice files are rewritting it entirely.  Bloodborne is the
				gothic game that never stops letting me dream.

				<h2>Nier: Automata</h2>
				<p>
				Yoko Taro, Director at Square Enix, is rapidly becoming known for his works that ask
				greater questions than media has previously answered.  With Nier, his beloved spinoff
				to the Drakengard franchise, he asked his players a question of perspective in conflict - 
				is "doing the right thing" an honest justification for atrocities committed?  In times
				of war, can either side truly be in the right?  Nier: Automata elevates these ideas, telling
				a complex story of human morals through the androids they've created.

				<h2>Life is Strange</h2>
				<p>
				Few games have told a more "classic" story than Life is Strange while also breaking the
				mold in depiction of human interaction.  Life is Strange is not afraid to tell its players
				stories of queer characters, mental health issues, drug abuse - and succeeds at creating
				accountability for not protecting those they love.
